**Course Description: Intermediate JavaScript Language Skills and Coding Practices**

**Course Number:** SCRPT-101
**Duration:** 3 days

**Intermediate JavaScript Training Overview**

Accelebrate's Intermediate JavaScript Language Skills and Coding Practices training class is a hands-on course that teaches attendees how to use JavaScript language skills such as regular expressions, closures and Ajax, and how to write fast-executing code that conforms to established best practices.

**Intermediate JavaScript Training Prerequisites**

All attendees must have prior HTML, CSS, and JavaScript development experience.

**Intermediate JavaScript Training Materials**

All Intermediate JavaScript training students receive a copy of O'Reilly's JavaScript: The Good Parts and related courseware.

**Software Needed on Each Student PC**

-   Web or text editor of your choice

-   Web browsers - a recent version of one or more of the following:

    -   Google Chrome

    -   Mozilla Firefox

    -   Internet Explorer (9 or later)

    -   Safari (5 or later)

    -   Opera

    -   For classes delivered online, all participants need either dual monitors or a separate device logged into the online session so that they can do their work on one screen and watch the instructor on the other. A separate computer connected to a projector or large screen TV would be another way for students to see the instructor's screen simultaneously with working on their own.
